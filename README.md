> An outlier is an observation, that deviates so much from other observations as to arouse suspicion that it was generated by a different mechanism.

Two ways to find anamolies with clustering
- Cluster **big amount of data** with k-means and histograms
- Apply clustering **independently to million of users**, to each identify the patterns with dbscan algorithm
